{"name":"PyPop","tagline":"Python for Population Genomics","body":"PyPop: Python for Population Genomics\r\n\r\n> * PyPop 0.7.0 (latest release), used in the Solberg et al. *Human Immunology* meta-analysis paper, is available.\r\n> * Also available as an official Fedora package\r\n\r\n###Overview\r\n\r\nPyPop (Python for Population Genomics) is an environment developed by the Thomson lab for doing large-scale population genetic analyses including: (1) conformity to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, (2) tests for balancing or directional selection; (3) estimates of haplotype frequencies (and their distributions) and measures and tests of significance for linkage disequilibrium (LD).\r\n\r\nIt is an object-oriented framework implemented in [Python](http://www.pypop.org), a language with powerful features for interfacing with other languages, such as C (in which we have already implemented many routines and which is particularly suited to computationally intensive tasks).\r\n\r\nThe output of the analyses are stored in the XML. These output files can then be transformed using standard tools into many other data formats suitable for machine input (such as PHYLIP or input for spreadsheet programs such as Excel or statistical packages, such as R, plain text, or HTML for human-readable format. Storing the output in XML allows the final viewable output format to be redesigned at will, without requiring the (often time-consuming) re-running of the analyses themselves.\r\n\r\nAn outline of PyPop can be found in our 2007 *Tissue Antigens* and 2003 *PSB* [[papers|cite]]\r\n.\r\nPyPop (beta) is available for download\r\n\r\n* 2008-09-09: 0.7.0 release (many new features and bug fixes) ‚Üê Most recent\r\n* 2005-04-13: 0.6.0 released (new features and bug fixes)\r\n* 2004-03-09: 0.5.2 released (bug fix release, fixes Windows 98 .bat file problems)\r\n* 2004-02-26: 0.5.1 released (mainly a bug fix and maintainance release)\r\n* 2003-12-31: 0.5 released (first public beta)\r\n\r\n(Please note that links and documentation below always refer to the most recent release).\r\n\r\n###Binaries\r\n\r\nBeta binary versions of PyPop are now publicly available (see \"Getting and installing PyPop\" link below for links to the current binaries) for both:\r\n\r\n* GNU/Linux (the Linux binary needs a recent distribution that a recent glibc (2.8 has been tested): Fedora Core 9 is known to work, earlier versions of Red Hat such as the 7.x series and 8.0 are known to not work)\r\n* Official Fedora package available! As of early 2009, pypop is also an official Fedora package which works with Fedora 9 and later. (It is also available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (RHEL 5) if you install the optional EPEL add-on repository). You can install via yum using:\r\n```\r\nyum install pypop\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Windows (the binary has been tested on Windows 98, 2000 and XP)\r\n\r\nBoth binary packages are approximately 5.5 Mb downloads.\r\nSource\r\n\r\nPyPop is [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) (sometimes referred to as [open source](http://www.opensource.org/) software) and the source code is released under the terms of the \"copyleft\" GNU General Public License, or GPL (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html). This means even if we haven't compiled a binary for your platform, it is possible for you to download the source code and compile it yourself.\r\n\r\n###Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation for PyPop is contained in the ''PyPop User Guide''.\r\n\r\n* [''PyPop User Guide''](http://pypop.org/docs/) includes:\r\n   * [Getting and installing PyPop](http://pypop.org/docs/guide-chapter-install.html) (including links to the binaries and source code)\r\n   * [Getting started with PyPop](http://pypop.org/docs/guide-chapter-usage.html) (instructions on how to configure and run PyPop)\r\n   * [Interpreting PyPop output](http://pypop.org/docs/guide-chapter-instructions.html) (a description of the output statistics)\r\n* PyPop User Guide is also available as a [PDF](http://pypop.org/pypop-guide.pdf) [220 kB]\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that this is a beta release so it is highly likely that there may be bugs and wrinkles to iron out.
