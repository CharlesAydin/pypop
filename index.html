<p>PyPop: Python for Population Genomics</p>

<p>PyPop 0.7.0 (latest release), used in the Solberg et al. Human Immunology meta-analysis paper, is available.
Also available as an official Fedora package</p>

<p>PyPop public beta available for download
Overview</p>

<p>PyPop (Python for Population Genomics) is an environment developed by the Thomson lab for doing large-scale population genetic analyses including: (1) conformity to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, (2) tests for balancing or directional selection; (3) estimates of haplotype frequencies (and their distributions) and measures and tests of significance for linkage disequilibrium (LD).</p>

<p>It is an object-oriented framework implemented in the programming language Python. Python is a flexible scripting language which allows rapid prototyping of code and has powerful features for interfacing with other languages, such as C (in which we have already implemented many routines and which is particularly suited to computationally intensive tasks).</p>

<p>The output of the analyses are stored in the XML format (XML is the eXtensible Markup Language devised by the World Wide Web Consortium, and is a platform-independent, vendor-neutral, non-proprietary, open standard for storing data). These output files can then be transformed using standard tools into many other data formats suitable for machine input (such as PHYLIP or input for spreadsheet programs such as Excel or statistical packages, such as R, plain text, or HTML for human-readable format. Storing the output in XML allows the final viewable output format to be redesigned at will, without requiring the (often time-consuming) re-running of the analyses themselves.</p>

<p>An outline of PyPop can be found in our 2007 Tissue Antigens and 2003 PSB papers.
PyPop (beta) is available for download</p>

<a id="binaries" class="anchor" href="#binaries" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Binaries</h3>

<p>Beta binary versions of PyPop are now publicly available (see "Getting and installing PyPop" link below for links to the current binaries) for both:</p>

<pre><code>GNU/Linux (the Linux binary needs a recent distribution that a recent glibc (2.8 has been tested): Fedora Core 9 is known to work, earlier versions of Red Hat such as the 7.x series and 8.0 are known to not work)
Official Fedora package available! As of early 2009, pypop is also an official Fedora package which works with Fedora 9 and later. (It is also available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (RHEL 5) if you install the optional EPEL add-on repository). You can install via yum using:

yum install pypop

Windows (the binary has been tested on Windows 98, 2000 and XP)
</code></pre>

<p>Both binary packages are approximately 5.5 Mb downloads.
Source</p>

<p>PyPop is free software (sometimes referred to as open source software) and the source code is released under the terms of the "copyleft" GNU General Public License, or GPL (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html</a>). This means even if we haven't compiled a binary for your platform, it is possible for you to download the source code and compile it yourself.
Documentation</p>

<p>Documentation for PyPop is contained in the PyPop User Guide.</p>

<pre><code>PyPop User Guide includes:
    Getting and installing PyPop (including links to the binaries and source code)
    Getting started with PyPop (instructions on how to configure and run PyPop)
    Interpreting PyPop output (a description of the output statistics)
PyPop User Guide is also available as a PDF [220 kB]

<p>Please be aware that this is a beta release so it is highly likely that there may be bugs and wrinkles to iron out. Please direct all questions to Alex Lancaster at the address below.
